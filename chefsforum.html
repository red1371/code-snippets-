<p>Hello everybody, it's Shamus back again this month with the success of our last month in September using seasonal ingredients for our last meal of the month, fire-roasted chicken with sweet potatoes and mango chutney. </p>

<p>We're moving onto October, where we're looking for some new inspiration in consideration of October being the start of many religious and American holidays, including Halloween, Mabon, Samhain,  Yom Kippur, Columbus day and so on; we're considering doing a temporary, seasonal menu for the restaurant. So to start off with this week, we're looking at a few new items starting with our smoked salmon lox on a salt block garnished with cream cheese and tomato with pesto and cinnamon Raisin bread, or consider substituting that for our fantastic whole grain pumpernickel, (for our breakfast menu, served anytime)</p>

  
<p>Remember that these photos were taken from our test kitchen; they're not on the menu yet this month. I know we're a bit behind, but please bear with us as we try to flush out an entirely separate and new menu for the restaurant because I don't want to put anything out for our customers that is not perfect.</p>

<p>
    Take a look at these photos and let me know what you think. As always, you can leave a comment below, and I will receive it. It's always taken into consideration while we're doing our menus. Keep in mind that your comment won't be seen on the website. However, I will see them in private, so if you have a suggestion, please feel free to leave a suggestion comment or Concern. We honestly do hope you enjoy the holiday season and the new seasonal menu from Joe's diner and bar, so please keep tabs on us to see what else we come out with this month.
</p>

<p>I'm proud to announce the newest addition to our wine collection from Richlands NC and low coastal country. We have Huffman vineyards wine made from locally grown muscadine grapes and done in small batches, nothing over 700 gallons in a tank. This award-winning wine here's a new taste that is sure to pair well with most items on the menu. The three bottles on display here are</p>
<ul>
<li><a> Legacy red- is a red muscadine dry red wine with a very smooth taste </a></li>
<br>
<li><a> Noble- is a semi-sweet muscadine red wine infused with cacao chips with that little hint of chocolate in the red wine. It is one of my personal favorites</a></li>
<br>
<li><a> Carlos- is a semi-sweet white wine with a clean, crisp taste
We also have porch time which is a dry white wine with passion fruit infused into it through the fermentation process it is a very clean crisp wine that is deceptively sweet </a></li>
</ul>

<p>Joe's Diner and bar isn't named after the owner. Joes was named after
 the iconic pop culture restaurant from the early 90s. Joe's Diner was originally 
thought of as a place where a simple working man could get a good meal for an 
affordable price. At Joe's Diner and bar, we have modernized those values by 
keeping our menu affordable while serving up a fresh selection of food, 
and with updated menus coming out quarterly and weekly specials, not to mention 
some of the best cocktails you'll find anywhere in the US. Joe's values 
creativity while bringing our customers a welcoming experience </p>

<p>to bring our customers quality ingredients, the restaurant sources 
any food it can get locally. Not only that, we offer farmers competitive rates to
sell us those goods because we believe in giving back to the community, and in some
small way, we can contribute to the welfare and well-being of our local farmers
who work so hard to make the best ingredients money can buy</p>
  
<p>While we try our best to keep it local for our produce and meats, we like to expand our pallets
regarding our alcohol, and we have both imported and local beers and wines. We carry various brands of spirits and wine
all the way from Bordeaux, France, to Osaka, Japan and everywhere in between. 
You would be hard pressed to find a more well-stocked bar with better adept 
bartenders than at joes because at Joes, we understand that going to a restaurant 
is not an everyday occurrence, and when you want to go out for a nice sit-down meal,
 you want to be comfortable while also getting the best service, food, and drink 
possible while also not breaking the bank.</p>

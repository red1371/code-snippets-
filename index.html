<p>Joe's diner of North Carolina was founded in 2022 by kyle d.caudill and their friends. 
Joe's focuses on a limited menu with breakfast, lunch, and dinner in order to provide higher quality, freshness, and value.</p>

<p>With an unwavering focus on food quality and freshness, joe's has its own professional chefs who hand-craft meals with fresh, quality ingredients. 
They design each meal with all of the tender loving care of a home-cooked family gathering.</p>
  
<p>Try our made-from-scratch rolls complementary to the table or the
 wide selection of beer and wine any time. After 5 o'clock, the bar opens for cocktails and won't close till we do,  
last call is at midnight. While enjoying our wide selection of beverages, consider trying the "build your own burger" section or our famous fried pork chops
 with white sauce and a side of fully loaded mash potatoes smothered in our proprietary beef au jus gravy, and don't forget your choice of greens.</p>

<p>As a side note, we have vegetarian, vegan, dary-free, gluten free, tree nut and peanut-free, lactose-free, and kosher 
options to cater to your personal needs.</p>

<h2>Meet chef Seamus Blackwood</h2>
<main>
<nav></nav>
<p>he started his journey in food in 2008by going to school in Edinburgh school of food and wine. After getting five years of experience in some of the finest kitchens in Scotland, he decided to follow his family to the US with a dream of running his own kitchen. We here at Joe's were lucky enough to acquire his skills before someone else. Seamus adds a unique flavor to our all-American menu through his knowledge and use of different European cooking techniques, which aren't often used in the US. This sets Joe's apart in many ways and helps us draw in a larger, more diverse crowd of customers looking to try old favorites with a new twist. </p>

<p>Our monthly menu items here at Joe's our devised by shamus and are not likely to stick around every month. If you have a special request or suggestion for a monthly menu item, check out our chef's forum page, where you can leave notes. They have direct communication with the heart of the business, our chef, Seamus Blackwood</p>
